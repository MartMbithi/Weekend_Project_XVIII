# Weekend Project XVIII - Opensource Pharmacy Management System

This is a weekend project eposide 18 which is an opensource Pharmacy Management system with an inbuilt robust pos module.

### The Lowdown
The system combines a sleek, user-friendly interface with a rock-solid database designed to handle patient records, inventory management, and daily sales with ease. Plus, advanced security features ensure your data stays safe and sound, because safeguarding sensitive information is non-negotiable.

By automating repetitive chores like inventory tracking and record-keeping, this tool minimizes human error and boosts productivity. It’s tailored for pharmacists, pharmacy technicians, and staff, giving each role access to exactly the features they need—no fluff, no fuss.

Ultimately, this project isn’t just about streamlining workflows. It’s about empowering pharmacies to improve communication, meet regulatory requirements effortlessly, and contribute to universal healthcare goals.
